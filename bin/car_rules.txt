===== CAR RULES =====

Congratulations on renting your car! Let's talk about it.

Price:
These cars come at a low price. You'll be expected to return your car when you arrive at Willamette Valley.
To determine the price of your car, you'll roll two dice.
If you roll 2-3, your price will be $100 - $125.
If you roll 4-6, your price will be $125 - $150.
If you roll 7-9, your price will be $150 - $175.
If you roll 10-12, your price will be $175 - $200.

Driving:
You will roll to determine how far you drive.
Your roll multiplier is 50 - so whatever you roll, you'll drive 50x that many miles.
Every time you drive, a number will be generated for you from 1-100.
1-25: Traffic - lose one roll. Lose 50 additional gas miles and 1 morale point.
25-50: Get lost - lose two rolls. Lose 75 additional gas miles and 2 morale points.
50-60: Accident - lose one roll. Rent a new car and lose 3 morale points. Re-rented cars come at a fixed cost of $150.
60-100: No issues. Gain 1 morale point.

If you run out of gas on the road, you will be required to pay an additional $25 fee for a gas delivery.

Best of luck!
