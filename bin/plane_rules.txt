===== PLANE RULES =====

Congratulations on booking your flight! Let's talk about it.

Price:
To determine the price of your flight, you'll roll two dice.

For a layover:
If you roll 2-3, your price will be $200 - $225.
If you roll 4-6, your price will be $225 - $250.
If you roll 7-9, your price will be $250 - $275.
If you roll 10-12, your price will be $275 - $300.

For a direct flight:
If you roll 2-3, your price will be $300 - $325.
If you roll 4-6, your price will be $325 - $350.
If you roll 7-9, your price will be $350 - $375.
If you roll 10-12, your price will be $375 - $400.

TSA:
You have a 50/50 chance of making it through TSA safely.
If you make it through, you will gain 1 morale point.
If you don't make it through, you will lose half of your supplies and 1 morale point.

Flying:
You will roll to determine how far you fly.
Your roll multiplier is 75 - so whatever you roll, you'll fly 75x that many miles.
Every time you fly, a number will be generated for you from 1-100.
1-25: Turbulence - lose one roll and 1 morale point.
25-75 - No issues. Gain 1 morale point.
75-100: Your flight was grounded. You must rebook your flight. Rebooked flights come at a fixed cost of $150. Lose one roll and 3 morale points.

If you're on a layover, you have a 50/50 chance of making your connection.
If you miss your connection, you must rebook your flight. Rebooked flights come at a fixed cost of $150. Lose one roll and 3 morale points.
If you make your connection, you will gain 3 morale points.

Best of luck!
