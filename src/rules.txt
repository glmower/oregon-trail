===== RULES =====

Welcome to the Oregon Trail!

You will start with $1000.
You cannot make more money throughout the game, so be cautious!
If you reach bankruptcy, the game will be over.

Your score is calculated using four factors:
1. The money you have left.
2. The number of turns it took you.
3. The supplies you have left.
4. Your morale when you arrive.

The number of turns it took you is your base score.
The money and supplies you have left are weighted and added to your base score.
Your morale is your multiplier.

Each vehicle type introduces inherent risk.
For example, if you drive, you may hit traffic. This causes you to use your supplies faster.
If you take a layover, you may miss your connection. This uses supplies and costs additional mony.
Taking a direct flight is more expensive upfront but introduces less risk.
However, turbulence or other "regular" risks may cost you supplies.
Trains have the fewest risks associated with them. However, they travel the slowest.

Higher risk introduces higher reward in terms of your morale.
Your morale starts at 10.
You will lose one morale point every 10 rolls.
However, if things don't go your way, you can lose morale more rapidly.
If you arrive in Willamette Valley with a morale score < 1, your multiplier will be 0.5
