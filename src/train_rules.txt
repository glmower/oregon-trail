===== TRAIN RULES =====

Congratulations on buying your train tickets! Let's talk about it.

Price:
To determine the price of your ticket, you'll roll two dice.
If you roll 2-3, your price will be $50 - $62.
If you roll 4-6, your price will be $63 - $75.
If you roll 7-9, your price will be $75 - $87.
If you roll 10-12, your price will be $87 - $100.

Traveling:
You will roll to determine how far you travel.
Your roll multiplier is 25 - so whatever you roll, you'll travel 25x that many miles.
Every time you drive, a number will be generated for you from 1-100.
1-25: The train is stopped - lose one roll and 2 morale points.
25-50: Transfer lines - lose two rolls.
50-100: No issues. Gain 1 morale point.

Best of luck!
